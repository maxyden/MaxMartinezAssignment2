                    <p> -The setting of the game takes place in a far future, where mankind has 
                        colonized and expanded far beyond the miniscule barriers of the earth, as the 
                        human borders expand and the galaxy becomes civilized and populated, one 
                        power seems to be constantly reaching out expanding at a fast pace. From the 
                        rubbles and squabbles of control one faction calling themselves the Great 
                        Empire of the Vast has taken by force control of most of the galaxy, with their 
                        leader Gwhynhyldeth Blackquazar they seek to unite the entirety of all sentient 
                        live under one flag, whether by will or by force they will fall under the might of 
                        the great empire.</p>  
                    <p>-Here the people arenâ€™t so weak to fall over and let themselves be beaten a 
                        small rebel group across the system have started to form, and whiting are the 
                        people that chose to fight for a greater tomorrow. As a raid on a local prison 
                        strikes out the entire complex falls out of orders and slips from the tyrannical 
                        grasp of the empire. From this prison three dangerous and known offenders 
                        against the will of the vast have surfaced once more. Bill a dangerous man who 
                        holds conviction under those below him, he holds one of the prize relics of the 
                        empire a sword of domination specifically one that changes and carves a path to 
                        the wielders goal; Luczy Bluefire a hazardous mechanic known to supply the 
                        rebels of armaments, she is feared for her spontaneous nature and her dream of 
                        building an army of automated war machines. Finally, Snuff Zedd, a pompous 
                        individual one that has on several occasions infiltrated the ranks of the empire 
                        all for his own gains, he is the most unpredictable of them all. Now all three of 
                        them set out together to escape in their stolen vessel onto a galaxy drowned in fear.  </p>
